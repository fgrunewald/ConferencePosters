# Conference Posters
When attending a conference, often I would like to read posters or find references therein after the conference. 
Sometimes the conferences allow for an ePoster gallery and sometimes they don't. Sometimes the upload closes weeks 
before the conference and I miss the deadline. In the spirit of open science and allowing other people to find the 
posters afterwards I created this repro for all conference posters.

lying around. Feel free to ask for them or specific figures by raising an issue.
